## Built with
1. NextJS 14
2. Pocketbase
3. shadcn/ui + tailwind
4. @tanstack/query 5

Example implementation of the fullstack notion clone that uses pocketbase for the backend, including realtime support and auth! If you'd like to implement this follow [Antonio Erdeljac'](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac) youtube video on his [notion-clone-tutorial](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/notion-clone-tutorial). Refer to my implementation if you'd like to do it all with pocketbase!!


### TODO

* Implement OAuth auth/register flows.

#### Help and Improvements welcome!
