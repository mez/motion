# Motion (Notion clone)


## Built with
1. NextJS 14
2. Pocketbase
3. shadcn/ui + tailwind


Example implementation of the fullstack notion clone that uses pocketbase for the backend, including realtime support and auth! If you'd like to implement this follow [Antonio Erdeljac](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac) youtube video on his [notion-clone-tutorial](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/notion-clone-tutorial). Refer to my implementation if you'd like to do all with pocketbase.




### TODO

* Implement OAuth auth/register flows.
